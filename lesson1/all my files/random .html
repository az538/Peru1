      United forever in friendship and labour, Our mighty republics will ever
      endure. The Great Soviet Union will live through the ages. The dream of a
      people their fortress secure. Long live our Soviet motherland, Built by
      the people's mighty hand. Long live our people, united and free. Strong in
      our friendship tried by fire. Long may our crimson flag inspire, Shining
      in glory for all men to see. Through days dark and stormy where Great
      Lenin lead us Our eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above And Stalin our
      leader with faith in the people, Inspired us to build up the land that we
      love. Long live our Soviet motherland, Built by the people's mighty hand.
      Long live our people, united and free. Strong in our friendship tried by
      fire. Long may our crimson flag inspire, Shining in glory for all men to
      see. We fought for the future, destroyed the invaders, And brought to our
      homeland the laurels of fame. Our glory will live in the memory of nations
      And all generations will honour her name. Long live our Soviet motherland,
      Built by the people's mighty hand. Long live our people, united and free.
      Strong in our friendship tried by fire. Long may our crimson flag inspire,
      Shining in glory for all men to see.Unbreakable Union of freeborn
      Republics, Great Russia has welded forever to stand. Created in struggle
      by will of the people, United and mighty, our Soviet land! Sing to the
      Motherland, home of the free, Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong. O
      Party of Lenin, the strength of the people, To Communism's triumph lead us
      on! Through tempests the sunrays of freedom have cheered us, Along the new
      path where great Lenin did lead. To a righteous cause he raised up the
      peoples, Inspired them to labour and valourous deed. Sing to the
      Motherland, home of the free, Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong. O
      Party of Lenin, the strength of the people, To Communism's triumph lead us
      on! In the victory of Communism's immortal ideal, We see the future of our
      dear land. And to her fluttering scarlet banner, Selflessly true we always
      shall stand! Sing to the Motherland, home of the free, Bulwark of peoples
      in brotherhood strong. O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people, To
      Communism's triumph lead us on!
